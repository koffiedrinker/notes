# Getting libc version

Often you are only given the binary but not the libc used on the challenge server. It might be the case that you want to know exactly what libc binary is running on the system to exploit the binary.

## Leaking libc addresses

If you can overflow a stack and get control over EIP, you might jump to 'a' printf() call in the .text section with at the top of the stack the .got.plt. printf() will then start printing the .got.plt until it encounters a zero byte.

## libc addresses to libc

Use [libcdb](http://libcdb.com) or [niklasb' libc-database](https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database).
